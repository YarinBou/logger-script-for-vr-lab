# logger-script-for-vr
Unity project that detects when the user is looking at an object in Unity,
in addition, when the user looks at an object I make the object spin so it can be easier to detect when the raycast has been hit.

by the end of the run file it exports a JSON file that contains how many and when each object was viewed.

Because the script is generic, anybody can add objects to Unity without writing any code themselves.
